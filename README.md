# 🤟 Chatter Hands – Sign Language Learning Platform

Chatter Hands is a web-based platform designed to help **deaf and mute individuals** learn and practice **sign language** through interactive visual content.  
The project focuses on **accessibility, inclusion, and effective communication** using modern web technologies.

---

## 🌟 Features
- Learn sign language through visual demonstrations
- Clean, simple, and accessible UI
- Responsive design for all devices
- Emotion and gesture-based learning modules *(planned)*
- AI-powered hand gesture recognition *(planned)*

## 🧠 AI & Machine Learning (Beginner-Friendly Approach)
This project is planned to integrate **beginner-friendly AI** using **Python and MediaPipe** for real-time hand gesture recognition.

### 🔹 Planned AI Capabilities
- Real-time **hand landmark detection** using webcam
- Recognition of basic sign language gestures
- Visual feedback to help users learn correct gestures
- Sign-to-text conversion (basic level)

### 🔹 Why MediaPipe?
- Easy to learn and implement
- No heavy mathematical background required
- Works well with webcams in real-time
- Widely used for gesture and pose detection
